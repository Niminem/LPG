- Need to test VIRTUAL vs STORED generated columns for node/edge ids and labels.
  Currently, I've decided to just stick with VIRTUAL for now. There are good
  arguments for both and trade-offs for both. Even a blend may be necessary.
2/29/24:
- Update. Decided on normal columns for everything except labels. All unique
  labels will be given it's own partial index from the label column (nodes/edges).
  -- CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_nodes_person ON nodes(label)
  -- WHERE label = 'Person';
- Need to finish TODOs and figure out all graph traversal stuff.
